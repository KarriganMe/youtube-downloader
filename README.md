# Youtube Video Downloader
Created by <a href="https://github.com/KmeKerrigan">Kerrigan</a>

You can download PE file in <a href="https://github.com/KarriganMe/youtube-downloader/releases">releases</a>.

You just have to paste a link, choose a quality, choose if you want to have only video, only audio or both and push a Download button.
If there is no quality that you have chosen, it will download a lower quality (maximum possible).

IMPORTANT!
I advice to put it in a folder, i do not suggest you to leave this file in a Desktop, it will download additional file. This file is FFMPEG.exe. YOU CAN NOT DELETE IT! 
But even if you deleted it, it will check if file is located at the same folder as file itself is, if not, it will download it.
You can save it to anywhere, just your choice.
### Advanced
Coded on Python. Using yt-dlp, tkinter and customtkinter. Used Pyinstaller to compile.
